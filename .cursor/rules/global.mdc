This is a Tauri 2.0 project.

- Use https://v2.tauri.app/develop/calling-rust/ to learn how to write Rust functions that can be called from JavaScript.
- Use https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/store/ to store key value store data.
- Always use @tanstack/react-query for asynchronous tasks.
- All asynchronous tasks should be handled in the lib/query.ts file.
